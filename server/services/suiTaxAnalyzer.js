}
‚Ä¢ Export transaction history regularly for record keeping
‚Ä¢ Consult with a crypto-aware tax professional
‚Ä¢ Monitor regulatory changes in your jurisdiction
‚Ä¢ Consider using specific identification method for cost basis

‚öñÔ∏è COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST:
‚Ä¢ [ ] Track all buy/sell transactions with dates and amounts
‚Ä¢ [ ] Record staking rewards as income
‚Ä¢ [ ] Document DeFi interactions and yield farming
